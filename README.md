## Crypto Animal Rescue

We create this dApp for donate ether for animals cause, the dApp uses Arweave(http://arweave.net/) and Ethereum Smart Contracts.
We integrate the storage of Arweave with the Ethereum Smart contracts. We upload the image and the text description for the donation on Arweave and store the URL with the value info in the Smart contracts

You can test the dApp on rinkeby testnet:
https://arweave.net/xFrjGwAH85MphtWyZiURyFH5ICKBfaV40BjPLQSv2dM



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
